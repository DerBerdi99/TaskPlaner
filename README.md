# TaskPlaner
Some python files for task planning, analyzing and (why-not?) planting and gardening stuff

if you want, download the files and run the "Projekt1_main.py"!

For database usage create a file at "D:\Programmtests\DB\" and put all databases in there.
else recode all parts of the code where this  ^  appears to make it suit your file system.

For using the widgets create a file at"D:\Programmtests\Img\Widgets\" or recode it too.


This is my first pythonic project, it includes functionality as follows:
Task Planning:
  Create Tasks and stack them, add priorities, materials and descriptions
  Delete Tasks and protocol their outcome
Statistics:
  Insights in all completed tasks if successfull Y or not N 
  Analyzing some metrics (total accomplished, success, failure)
  Advanced metrics (sorted by timestamp or alphabetical order; 
    Individual Process success or 
    cumulated Process success (trend) 
PlantManager:
  create a "virtual garden" and choose plants
  get to know about mixed cropping agriculture of your plants
  find out perfect sewing and harvest times
PlantEncyclopedia:
  create own plants and draw a picture 
  explore your own plant collection

That's it and the PlantManager doesn't even work properly. Suspicious behavior..
have fun it is partwise in german!
